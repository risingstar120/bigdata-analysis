# Big Data Analytics - final project
## Overview
The aim of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a company will beat consensus estimates when they report earnings.

This information can then be used as the input to a trading system. It can also be used to gain a better insight into a company's earnings, maybe as a first step to further research.

## Data
We download OHLC(V) data from Yahoo. We gather earnings data from both Estimize and Quantdl/Zack's.
